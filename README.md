# 0x0A. Unity - 360 Video

This 360 video is meant to be experienced with an **Oculus Quest**. Please load the APK file from the **Builds directory** onto your Quest.

Once it's playing, you can tour the SF Holberton campus and interact with the virtual buttons by looking directly at them and pressing the A button on the right controller. A circular indicator will appear when you are looking directly at a button and are able to interact with it.
